Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
    Run the following command to clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/NotAPlumber505/Moodify-Spotify-Mood-Tracker.git
    Then navigate into the project folder:
    cd Moodify-Spotify-Mood-Tracker

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
    To avoid dependency conflicts, it's a good practice to create a virtual environment:

    Create a virtual environment:
    python -m venv venv

    Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate

    On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
    Install the required dependencies using pip:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up Configuration
    Store your Spotify API credentials in a .toml file (e.g., config.toml) with the following format:

    [spotify]
    client_id = "your-client-id"
    client_secret = "your-client-secret"
    redirect_uri = "your-redirect-uri"
    Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual Spotify credentials.

5. Run the Application
    Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can start the app by running:
    streamlit run app.py
    The app should open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.
